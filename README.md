# The-Guardian-Owl
The Guardian Owl Project was created as part of the SAS Hackathon. 



Our Goal: 	Creating an app and website using data we will analyze from the CDC to help expecting mothers determine their risk for various pregnancy complications and learn how to mitigate those risks.



The Team: 		Kaylee Garcia, Joey Roberts, Christopher Williams, Anastasiia Kanafeva, Karthik Nagesh, and Tom Ledger.



To run this project:
First, you need access to the PRAMS dataset. Get permission from the CDC.


Second, if you want to jump straight to the finished product, go to [SERVER_FILE_HERE] and click [FURTHER_INSTRUCTIONS]


If you want to see how the data was analyzed and what happens when the questionairre is submitted, then go to the folder named "analysis" and open "SAS data.ipynb". This was the first round of data exploration and cleaning. Next, read through "correlation_analysis.ipynb". This is where we identified the target variables and the most important predictor variables for each target. [DESCRIBE THE REST OF THE FILES]
